# Queue

>   A ```Queue``` is a **linear data structure** which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is ```First In First Out (FIFO)```.

> 
    A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

>   The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a ```stack``` we remove the item the most recently added <br> In a ```queue```, we remove the item the least recently added.
