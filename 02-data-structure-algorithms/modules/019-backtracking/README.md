# Backtracking

> A backtracking algorithm tries to build a solution to a computational problem incrementally. Whenever the
algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it simply
tries all possible options recursively.

> If you have followed my project from starting - You should not have any difficulty to understand this statement.

### In Simple words:
* It means basically - exploring all the paths possible to get the answer.
* It is an approach which we can use to solve our problem and how we can implement this approach is basically , we call as recursion.
