/**
 *  Operators in C++
 *  =================
 *  1.  Arithmetic operators:
 *      --------------------
 *      ->  These are used in mathematical operations in the same way as that in algebra.
 *      ->      OPERATOR    -   DESCRIPTION
 *                  +       -   Add two operands
 *                  -       -   Subtracts second operand from the first
 *                  *       -   Multiplies two operands
 *                  /       -   Divides numerator by denominator
 *                  %       -   Calculates Remainder of division
 *  2.  Relational operators:
 *      --------------------
 *      ->  C++ relational operators specify the relation between two variables by comparing them.
 *      ->  Following table shows the relational operators that are supported by C++.
 *              OPERATOR    -   DESCRIPTION
 *                  ==      -   Checks if two operands are equal
 *                  !=      -   Checks if two operands are not equal
 *                  >       -   Checks if operand on the left is greater than operand on the right
 *                  <       -   Checks if operand on the left is lesser than operand on the right
 *                  >=      -   Checks if operand on the left is greater than or equal to operand on the right
 *                  <=      -   Checks if operand on the left is less than or equal to operand on the right
 *  3.  Logical operators:
 *      -----------------
 *      ->  C++ supports 3 types of logical operators. The result of these operators is a boolean value i.e., 
 *          True(BITWISE ‘1’) or False(BITWISE ‘0’). Refer the visual representation below:
 *              OPERATOR    -   DESCRIPTION
 *                  &&      -   Logical AND
 *                  ||      -   Logical OR
 *                  !       -   Logical NOT
